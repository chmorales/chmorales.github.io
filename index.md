## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Stony Brook University on Long Island, New York. I am enrolled in the Honors College as well as the Computer Science Honors program, where I get the opportunity to work with some of the smartest people I have ever met. 

I am particuarly interested in information security, and am looking to pursue a career in that field. In an age where most of our personal information is kept in online databases, the need for robust privacy and security models is at an all time high. Plus, in light of recent breaches and compromises of critical computer systems around the world, it seems that the security community has some catching up to do. I want to be part of the solution.

Outside of class, I work in a information security lab on campus, focusing on program security and data protection. Projects I have completed include a "self-randomizing" debian package framework and a couple binary instrumentation tools. I also have interned at a company called Zignage LLC, located in Manhattan, New York, working on digital signage solutions for high profile clients such as 2k Games and the NYSE.

## Coding Projects

### [Sniffles Packet Sniffer](https://github.com/chmorales/sniffles)

This is a network packet sniffer written in Python. It supports the Ethernet, ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, and DNS protocols. The binary data parsing for packet sniffing was done using the [Construct](https://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) library. Construct is a declarative and symmetrical binary data building and parsing library and supports a wide range of differnt data types.

### [Python Security Tools](https://github.com/chmorales/PythonSecurityTools)

The first tool is an ARP cache poisoning detector, which can detect a malicious machine attempting to poison your local ARP cache which is usually done to set up a man in the middle attack. The second is an HTTP Cookie Capturer which will survey an interface and capture all the cookies of HTTP packets it finds. The third is a TCP SYN Scanner, which performs a TCP SYN scan over a range of IPs and ports in an attempt to fingerprint services running on said ports.

### Self Randoming Debian Packages

In an information security lab where I am an assistant, I was asked to create an implementation of a binary randomization toolchain developed by the researchers. I came up with a framework that takes advantage of the debian packaging system and thus performs the randomization of the installed software with no user intervention. This was an important aspect of the implementation because often security is given up in the interest of ease of use.

### [Open Street Map GPS Application](https://github.com/chmorales/OpenStreetMapApp)

This app parses Open Street Map Project data (formatted as XML) and offers a GPS like service to its user. You can zoom in and observe named locations on the map and find shortest paths from any two points on the map.
