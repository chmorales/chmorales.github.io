## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Stony Brook University on Long Island, New York. I am enrolled in the Honors College as well as the Computer Science Honors program, where I get the opportunity to work with some of the smartest people I have ever met. 

I am particuarly interested in information security, and am looking to pursue a career in that field. In an age where most of our personal information is kept in online databases, the need for robust privacy and security models is at an all time high. Plus, in light of recent breaches and compromises of critical computer systems around the world, it seems that the security community has some catching up to do. I want to be part of the solution.

Outside of class, I volunteer some of my time in a information security lab on campus, focusing on program security. Projects I have completed include a "self-randomizing" debian package framework and a couple binary instrumentation tools. I also have interned at a company called Zignage LLC, located in New York, New York, working on digital signage solutions for high profile clients.
